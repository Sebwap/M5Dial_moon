# M5Dial_moon
View lunar cycle on your M5Dial
Also an option to view rotating earth

## Images thanks to NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio:
Moon: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4310/
Earth: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3639/

Pictures have been resized to 240x240 px with Gimp, and I then keep only one over xxx to keep around 48 pictures for each animation, due to memory limitation on M5Dial.

## Command:
- Touch screen to pause animation
- When paused, use the rotary encoder to go to next / previous picture.
- Use the click button of the rotary encode to switch between moon and earth.
